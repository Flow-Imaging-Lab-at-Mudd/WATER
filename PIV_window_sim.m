% This function simulates 3D PIV windowing effects (i.e. converts from voxel
% to interrogation window scale)
% Written by Leah Mendelson & Derek Li

function [Xwin, Uwin] = PIV_window_sim(X, U, winsize, overlap, Xscale)
% inputs
% X: 4D matrix of input vector field coordinates (analogous to voxels)
% U: Matching 4D matrix of velocity vector components at input field resolution
% winsize: simulated interrogation window size, specified as a power of
% 2 (typical range 16-128 voxels). Can be given a uniform scalar value
% or 3-vector of x y z window sizes.
% overlap: Overlap between interrogation windows as a fraction of the window
% size in voxels (typically 0.5 or 0.75). A uniform overlap in each direction
% is assumed.
% Xscale: Vector for how the subsetted positions are to be scaled, where
% all positions will be non-negative and proceed from (0 0 0) by the
% increments specified by 'Xscale'.
%
% outputs
% Xwin: output vector field coordinates (in pixels, analogous
% to interrogation window resolution)
% Uwin: filtered velocity vector components at output field
% resolution
